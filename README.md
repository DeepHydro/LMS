#  Lake Modeling System
## Description
Lake Modeling System(LMS) is an integrated graphic modeling system designed for three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality simulation in lakes. 
   
## Features
* Provides necessary functionalities streamlined for hydrodynamic and  water quality simulation in lakes 
* Provides a geographic information system (GIS)-based data processing framework to establish a model and provides capabilities for displaying model input and output informatio

### Prerequisites
* [NET Framework 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/net452)
   
## Major Libraries
  Several third-party libraries are used when developing LMS:
* The hydrodynamic and  water quality model is based on [FVCOM](http://fvcom.smast.umassd.edu/)
* The GIS environment is based on [DotSpatial](https://github.com/DotSpatial)
